            <p>
                This website is for our IT Graduate Programme newcomers and any interested participants. SSE IT provides the technology needs of all the different businesses that make up the SSE Group. Graduates on this scheme will gain exposure to many areas such as emerging technology, infrastructure support, system architecture and project management. Youâ€™ll learn just as much about how we use technology to support the business and our customers as you do the technical aspects.</p>
